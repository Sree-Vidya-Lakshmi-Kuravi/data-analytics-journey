## Day 07 — SQL Window Functions & Advanced Analysis

- Applied window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK) with PARTITION BY and ORDER BY to perform ranking and top-N analysis within groups.
- Compared GROUP BY and window functions on the same problems to clearly understand when aggregation vs row-level analysis is required.
- Wrote interview-grade consolidation queries combining joins and window functions, with clear comments explaining business intent and use cases.

## Day 03 — SQL Basics & Aggregations

- Practiced core SQL querying using SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, IN, and BETWEEN to filter and retrieve relevant data.
- Applied aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) with GROUP BY to answer customer- and order-level business questions.
- Used HAVING to filter aggregated results, with every query documented using clear business-oriented comments.
